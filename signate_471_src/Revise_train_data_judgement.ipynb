Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is the diagnostic criterion for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nevertheless, RNA detection has many limitations, such as being time-consuming and cost-prohibitive, and it must be performed in specialized laboratories. Virus antibody detection is a routine method for screening for multiple viruses, but data about SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection are limited. METHOD: Throat swabs and blood were collected from 67 suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection patients at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University and Zunyi Fourth People's Hospital isolated observation departments. Throat swab samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by real-time PCR. Blood was used subjected to SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM detection by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and gold immunochromatography assay (GICA). Blood underwent C-reactive protein detection by immunoturbidimetry, and white blood cells, neutrophil percentages and lymphocyte percentages were counted and calculated, respectively. Clinical symptoms, age and lifestyle habits (smoking and drinking) in all patients were recorded. Data were analysed using SPSS version 19. The results were confirmed by T and chi2 tests; correlations with detection results were analysed by kappa coefficients. Odds ratio (OR) and corrected OR values were analysed by logistic regression. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients included in this study, 26 were SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive. GICA IgM sensitivity was 50.9% (13/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgM sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 90.2% (37/41). ELISA IgG sensitivity was 76.9% (20/26), and specificity was 95.1% (39/41). The kappa coefficients between RNA detection and ELISA IgG, ELISA IgM, and GICA IgM results were 0.741 (P < 0.01), 0.681 (P < 0.01) and 0.430 (P < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Among the candidate blood indicators, serum IgG and IgM detected by ELISA had the best consistency and validity when compared with standard RNA detection; these indicators can be used as potential preliminary screening tools to identify those who should undergo nucleic acid detection in laboratories without RNA detection abilities or as a supplement to RNA detection.\""]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":140},"id":"1vZ1U0QVUGbB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1631539204575,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":622,"user":{"displayName":"KAZUKI HIRAHARA","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"09073430568031937610"}},"outputId":"cd981353-4f7e-4e5a-ca33-45a7966067c8"},"source":["train_1.iloc[1].abstract"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["\"Diagnostic accuracy in FDG-PET imaging highly depends on the operating procedures.

We evaluated the added value of FDG-PET  either Standard FDG Images or SPM Maps  to Clinical Scenarios. In 88 patients with neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's Disease-AD  Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration-FTLD  Dementia with Lewy bodies-DLB and Mild Cognitive Impairment-MCI)  9 neuroimaging experts made a forced diagnostic decision on the basis of the evaluation of the three types of information. There was also the possibility of a decision of normality on the FDG-PET images. The clinical diagnosis confirmed at a long-term follow-up was used as the gold standard. SPM Maps showed higher sensitivity and specificity (96% and 84%)  and better diagnostic positive (6.8) and negative (0.05) likelihood ratios compared to Clinical Scenarios and Standard FDG Images. SPM Maps increased diagnostic accuracy for differential diagnosis (AD vs. FTD; beta 1.414  p = 0.019). The AUC of the ROC curve was 0.67 for SPM Maps  0.57 for Clinical Scenarios and 0.50 for Standard FDG Images.

An automatic disease detection framework assists doctors in the diagnosis of disease and provides exact, consistent, and fast results and reduces the death rate. Coronavirus (COVID-19) has become one of the most severe and acute diseases in recent times and has spread globally. Therefore, an automated detection system, as the fastest diagnostic option, should be implemented to impede COVID-19 from spreading. This paper aims to introduce a deep learning technique based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to diagnose COVID-19 automatically from X-ray images. In this system, CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. A collection of 4575 X-ray images, including 1525 images of COVID-19, were used as a dataset in this system. The experimental results show that our proposed system achieved an accuracy of 99.4%, AUC of 99.9%, specificity of 99.2%, sensitivity of 99.3%, and F1-score of 98.9%. The system achieved desired results on the currently available dataset, which can be further improved when more COVID-19 images become available. The proposed system can help doctors to diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients easily.

Methods We aimed at examining sensitivity of combined visual and semi-quantitative 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT analyses in a prospective cohort of subjects with DLB and degenerative parkinsonisms - Parkinson's disease (PD)  multiple system atrophy (MSA)  corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) to determine prevalence and clinical significance of scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD). 372 scans performed from 2013 to 2016 with the same SPECT acquisition and processing protocol were analyzed. We identified 155 patients with degenerative parkinsonism and 53 with DLB. Diagnoses relied on validated clinical criteria for each condition. Semi-quantitative assessment was based on previously established local reference limits (including striatal volumes of interest uptake  caudate-to-putamen ratio and striatal asymmetry index). Results 3/155 (2.1%) subjects with degenerative parkinsonism (1 CBS  1 MSA-C and 1 PD) and 1/53 (1.9%) with DLB had a normal visual SPECT. Subsequent semi-quantitative analysis showed mild striatal uptake impairment for the DLB and the PD subject. Therefore  only two patients (1 CBS and 1 MSA) had a strictly normal combined assessment. Conclusions The present study shows that SWEDD cases represent a negligible proportion of patients with degenerative conditions (1.3%)  when stringent diagnostic criteria are applied  a thorough follow-up is performed and visual SPECT analysis is combined with precise semi-quantitative assessment.\""]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":24}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"uY6tZkVaV0m4"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":200},"id":"ZNsILiZP5TQw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1630556855131,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"KAZUKI HIRAHARA","photoUrl":"","userId":"09073430568031937610"}},"outputId":"8113a610-a761-487b-855f-e0dda990f920"},"source":["train[\"title_abst\"] = train[\"title\"] + train[\"abstract\"]\n","train[\"title_abst\"].fillna(train[\"title\"], inplace=True)\n","\n","test[\"title_abst\"] = test[\"title\"] + test[\"abstract\"]\n","test[\"title_abst\"].fillna(test[\"title\"], inplace=True)\n","\n","\n","train.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <th>abstract</th>\n","      <th>judgement</th>\n","      <th>title_abst</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>One-year age changes in MRI brain volumes in o...</td>\n","      <td>Longitudinal studies indicate that declines in...</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>One-year age changes in MRI brain volumes in o...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Supportive CSF biomarker evidence to enhance t...</td>\n","      <td>The present study was undertaken to validate t...</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Supportive CSF biomarker evidence to enhance t...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>Occurrence of basal ganglia germ cell tumors w...</td>\n","      <td>Objective: To report a case series in which ba...</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Occurrence of basal ganglia germ cell tumors w...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>New developments in diagnosis and therapy of C...</td>\n","      <td>The etiology and pathogenesis of idiopathic ch...</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>New developments in diagnosis and therapy of C...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in an elderly...</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in an elderly...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   id  ...                                         title_abst\n","0   0  ...
