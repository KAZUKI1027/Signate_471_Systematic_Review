To determine the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein using 4 automated immunoassays and 3 ELISAs for the detection of total Ig antibodies (Roche) or IgG (Abbott, Diasorin, Snibe, Euroimmun, Mikrogen) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Sensitivity and dynamic trend to seropositivity were evaluated in 233 samples from 114 patients with moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19 confirmed with PCR on nasopharyngeal swab. Specificity was evaluated in 113 samples collected before January 2020 including 24 samples from patients with non-SARS coronavirus infection. RESULTS: Sensitivity for all assays was 100% [95% confidence interval: 83.7-100] 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Specificity varied between 94.7% [88.7-97.8] and 100% [96.1-100]. Calculated at the cut-offs that corresponded to a specificity of 95% and 97.5%, Roche had the highest sensitivity (85.0% [79.8-89.0] and 81.1% [76.6-85.7], p <0.05 except vs. Abbott). Seroconversion occurred on average 2 days earlier for Roche total Ig anti-N and the 2 IgG anti-N assays (Abbott and Euroimmun) than for the 2 IgG anti-S assays (Diasorin and Euroimmun) (>=50% seroconversion day 9-10 vs. day 11-12, and p <0.05 for % seropositive patients day 9-10 to 17-18). There was no significant difference in the IgG antibody time to seroconversion between critical and non-critical patients. CONCLUSIONS: Seroconversion occurred within 3 weeks after onset of symptoms with all assays and on average 2 days earlier for assays detecting IgG or total Ig anti-N than for IgG anti-S. The specificity of assays detecting anti-N was comparable to anti-S and excellent in a challenging control population. Copyright Â© 2020.
